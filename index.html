              The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure
              game developed and published by Nintendo. The game is an
              installment of The Legend of Zelda series and is set at the end of
              its timeline. The player controls an amnesiac Link, who awakens
              from a hundred-year slumber, and attempts to regain his memories
              and prevent the destruction of Hyrule by Calamity Ganon. The world
              in this game features minimal structure and is designed to
              encourage exploration and experimentation, and the main story
              quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.

            <p>
              Explore the landscape of Hyrule any way you like. Climb up towers
              and mountain peaks in search of new destinations, then set your
              own path and plunge into the wilderness. With this much real
              estate to explore, Link will need some help in his travels.
              Luckily, there are plenty of transportation options to unlock.
              Link can cover a lot of ground quickly on horseback, navigate the
              waters of Hyrule on a raft, or hit the slopes and surf down a
              mountain on his shield. And the sky's the limit when Links soars
              through the sky with his paraglider.

              When Link first wakes up, he's unarmed and defenseless. Relying on
              his wits and resourcefulness, though, he can acquire over 180
              different weapons to use in combat. These items will wear out over
              time, though, so he must always be on the lookout for more.
              There's more to fighting than just weapons, of course. Link will
              also have to learn a variety of different attacks—like high-flying
              bow shots and making use of explosives—in order to prevail.
